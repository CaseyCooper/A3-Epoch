Create a folder in your epoch.Altis (or epoch.Chernarus) pbo called custom/LSpawner and copy all the files from the first post into it. 

In your init.sqf, make sure it looks like this:

if (isServer) then {
    fn_getBuildingstospawnLoot = compile preProcessFileLineNumbers "custom\LSpawner\fn_LSgetBuildingstospawnLoot.sqf";
    LSdeleter = compile preProcessFileLineNumbers "custom\LSpawner\LSdeleter.sqf";
    execVM "custom\LSpawner\Lootspawner.sqf";
};
To edit the chances for loot to spawn, open Lootspawner.sqf and edit these lines. The explanation of each value is shown above those lines in Lootspawner.sqf:

spawnClassChance_list = [
[0, 13, 21, 24, 18, 22],	// civil
[1, 22, 36, 28, 26, 18],	// military
[2, 10, 21, 28, 26, 36],	// industrial
[3, 12, 36, 36, -1, -1]		// research
];
